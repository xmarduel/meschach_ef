	To build a straight C version of the library use the build.bat
	file. If you want the Fortran interfaces then use fbuild.bat.

	In the makefiles (ie the ones ending in .msc), you'll have to 
	change where -I option looks for the header file vogle.h. Also
	you should have the vogle.lib in your library search path.
