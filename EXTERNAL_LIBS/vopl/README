The directories in this directory contain the source for the VOPL library,
and the graph plotting program gpp.

They are as follows:

	docs		contains the documentation such as there is.

	examples	some C and FORTRAN example programs.

VOPL is a library of routines for doing fits and graph plots written using
the VOGLE graphics library. We are still developing VOPL so constructive 
comments and Beer are always welcome.

We wish to thank Felix Huber for contributing the histogram code.
