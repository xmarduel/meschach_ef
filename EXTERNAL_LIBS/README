It seems that the vogle lib version 2.0b has completely disappered from the internet! What a pity!

It was the version I used and modified for my purpose. I have forgotten what I have modified...(about 20 years ago)
The version 2.0b had support for multiple windows (good).
- cocoa or xxxx support (what was the name of the mac api before cocoa ? I have forgotten!)

Moreover, I ported the vopl lib (for graphs) to the same level + some nice extensions....
So there are in vopl plenty of changes.
So far as I remember (20 years ago), I added
- winopen stuff as in vogle-2.0b (multiple windows)
- sub-viewports API as in pgplot
- contours lines on a ucd mesh
