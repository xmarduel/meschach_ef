I'm using a modified version of vogle-2.0b for my purpose. I have forgotten what I have modified...(about 20 years ago)
The version 2.0b had support for multiple windows (good).
- cocoa or carbon support (seems to be broken, I do not known why nowadays)
- ppm speed up (nice when generating ppm on the fly during animation)
- what else ?

Moreover, I ported the vopl lib (for graphs) to the same level + some nice extensions....
So there are in vopl plenty of changes.
So far as I remember (20 years ago), I added
- winopen stuff as in vogle-2.0b (multiple windows)
- double instead of float for array of values
- sub-viewports API as in pgplot
- contours lines on a ucd mesh
