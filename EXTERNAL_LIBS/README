- be sure the "graph" executable is in your "PATH"

build in the project (modified)

follow the instructions 
- g77 must be on system
- rename untar'ed folder "pgplot_srcs"
- create new "pgplot" folder and copy in it the file "drivers.list"
- cd in your "pgplot" folder
- drivers.list: select PNG, PPM, GIF, XWINDOW, XSERVE, XADRIV(ATHENA) - not Motif!

ppm and gif: see the drivers source code and modify it accordingly to the 
indication given in the source files: "INTEGER -> INTEGER*8"

- ../pgplot_srcs/makemake ../pgplot_srcs  linux g77_gcc

I'm using a modified version of vogle-2.0b for my purpose. I have forgotten what I have modified...(about 20 years ago)
The version 2.0b had support for multiple windows (good).
- cocoa or carbon support (seems to be broken, I do not known why nowadays)
- ppm speed up (nice when generating ppm on the fly during animation)
- what else ?

Moreover, I ported the vopl lib (for graphs) to the same level + some nice extensions....
So there are in vopl plenty of changes.
So far as I remember (20 years ago), I added
- winopen stuff as in vogle-2.0b (multiple windows)
- double instead of float for array of values
- sub-viewports API as in pgplot
- contours lines on a ucd mesh

how to compile the "hershey" fonts from vogle ?
TODO
