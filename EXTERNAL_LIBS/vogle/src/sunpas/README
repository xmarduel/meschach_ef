	Using the SUN Pascal interface to vogle.
	----------------------------------------

	a)	You must run the SUN Pascal compiler 'pc'.

	b)	All Pascal programs using vogle routines must include the
		file "Vogle.h" after the program statement.
		This file contains the declarations for all the vogle
		functions and procedures as well as several useful types.

	c)	A typical compile and link sequence might be:

		pc -o myprog myprog.p -lvogle -lsuntool -lsunwindow 
			-lpixrect -lm

	NOTE:- If you are using the 'sun' device then you should be running
	sunview (suntools).

	OTHER NOTES:- All string data that is to be used in vogle routines
	must be of type 'string_t' (defined in Vogle.h)


	The philosophy behind this Pascal interface is that we didn't
	want to change the 'notional' names of any of the routines. But
	we had to have different names for some routines to satisfy the
	C/Pascal calling conventions. We simply made the names by
	capitalising the first letter of each word in the name - eg move
	==> Move and viewport ==> ViewPort. We didn't feel this was a
	problem because it is the style of procedure naming that makes X
	and Pascal programmers feel all warm and gooey inside :-). All
	these names are in the header file Vogle.h
	
	In case any of you are wondering why some of the interfaces to
	string routines only seem to be passing a single integer, here's
	the reason why: We use the SUN pascal type varying [1..255] of char.
	This type is allocated as a 4 byte integer followed by an array
	of characters. Hence we get passed a 4 byte integer and the actual
	string data is just after that.

	Finally, a special thanks to Peter Horan (peter@cm.deakin.OZ.AU)
	for all his work on the interface.


	PS. There seems to be a difference between SUN Pascal 1.1 and 2.0
	We only have 2.0 - if you have problems with 1.1 let us know.
