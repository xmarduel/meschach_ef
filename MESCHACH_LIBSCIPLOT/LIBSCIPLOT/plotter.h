/* This file contains the point plotter half of GNU graph.  The point
   plotter could easily be linked with other software.  It translates a
   sequence of points, regarded as defining a polyline or a sequence of
   polylines, to a sequence of libplot calls.  There is support for
   multigraphing, i.e. producing a plot consisting of more than a single
   graph.  Each graph may be drawn from more than one file, i.e., input
   stream, and each input stream may provide more than a single polyline.
   
   A `point' is a structure.  Each point structure contains the following
   fields:

      x and y coordinates of the point
      a `have_x_errorbar' flag (true or false)
      a `have_y_errorbar' flag (true or false)
      xmin and xmax (meaningful only if have_x_errorbar is set)
      ymin and ymax (meaningful only if have_y_errorbar is set)
      a `pendown' flag

      a symbol type (a small integer, interpreted as a marker type)
      a symbol size (a fraction of the size of the plotting box)
      a symbol font name (relevant only for symbol types >= 32)
      a linemode (a small integer)
      a linewidth (a fraction of the size of the display device)
      a polyline fill-fraction (in the interval [0,1], <0 means no fill)
      a use_color flag (true or false)

   The point plotter constructs a polyline from each successive run of
   points that have the pendown flag set.  It assumes that the final seven
   fields are assumed to be the same for each point in such a run, i.e., it
   takes their values from the first point of the run.  At the location of
   each point on the polyline, the appropriate marker symbol, if any, will
   be plotted.  Symbol types greater than or equal to 32 are interpreted as
   single characters to be plotted, rather than symbols.

   Points without the pendown flag set cause the polyline to be broken, and
   a new one to begin, before the symbol (if any) is plotted.  

   The plotter supports five basic linemodes: 1 through 5.  The
   interpretation of `linemode' depends on the polyline's use_color flag.

	   linemode		If monochrome 		If color

	       1		solid			red
	       2		dotted			green
	       3		dotdashed		blue
	       4		shortdashed		magenta
	       5		longdashed		cyan

   In the monochrome case, the pattern simply repeats: 6,7,8,9,10 are
   equivalent to 1,2,3,4,5, etc.  In the colored case, the sequence of
   colors also repeats.  But linemodes 1,2,3,4,5 are drawn solid, while
   6,7,8,9,10 are drawn dotted, 11,12,13,14,15 are drawn dotdashed, etc.
   So there are 25 distinct colored linemodes, and 5 distinct monochrome
   (black) ones.

   The color of a symbol will be the same as the color of the polyline on
   which it is plotted.

   linemodes -1, -2, etc. have a special interpretation.  They are
   `disconnected' linemodes: no polyline will appear, but if color is
   being used, the color of the plotted symbols (if any) will be
   linemode-dependent.  -1,-2,-3,-4,5 signify red,green,blue,magenta,cyan
   (the same sequence as for 1,2,3,4,5); thereafter the sequence repeats.

   linemode 0 is special (for backward compatibility).  No line is drawn;
   symbol #1 (a point) will be used.  So using linemode 0 is the same as
   using linemode -1, symbol 1.

   The point plotter is invoked by calling the following, in order.

   new_multigrapher() creates a new point plotter.
   begin_graph()
   set_graph_parameters() initializes global structures used by 
   	the draw_frame_of_graph() and plot_point() routines.  These include
	the structures that specify the linear transformation from user
	coordinates to the coordinates used by libplot, and structures
	that specify the style of the plot frame.  
   draw_frame_of_graph() plots the graph frame.  [Optional.]
   plot_point() uses libplot routines to plot a single point, together 
   	with (possibly)	a line extending to it from the last point, and 
	a symbol. [Alternatively, plot_point_array() can be used, to plot 
	an array of points.]
   end_graph()
   ..
   [The begin_graph()..end_graph() block can be repeated indefinitely
    if desired, to create a multigraph.  set_graph_parameters() allows
    for repositioning of later graphs.]
   ..
   delete_multigrapher() deletes the point plotter.

   There is also a function end_polyline_and_flush(), which is useful for
   real-time display. */
