# meschach_ef
my **very** old finite element library, based on the meschach library.

- 1D -> lots of fe : P1,P2,P3, Hermite, Splines S2,S3,S4,S5  for periodic geometries or not
- 2D -> P1,P2,P3
- 3D -> P1,P2,P3

with triangles/tetrahedras only

Very nice python wrapper (2.7)


As Xcode project (10.1) for macOS 10.14

External libs to compile separately.
