This directory contains example programs which may also be used in testing a
new driver. If you are testing a new driver the trivial.{c,f} is of most
use, followed by views.{c,f}, and then poly.{c,f}. When those three work, try
the others. loc.{c,f} can be used for testing the mouse device if you have
one.

From the point of view of learning how to use VOGLE the suggested reading
order is below.

teapot.c, beer.c  and showg.c is provided for the general interest.


If you are using SUNVIEW or an X11 toolkit, there are additional examples
in the directories sunview, xview and xt.
