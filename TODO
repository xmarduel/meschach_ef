- finish HTML doc with many many examples, especially Stokes/Navier-Stoke
(will I ever have the time for it ?)

- re-run mcstrip/cyclo, seems buggy on macosx (wrong function names)
- nroff doc update (I have forgotten how to do this)

- Makefile for linux

- graphics: specifiy colors in config files
- change MATLAB to OCTAVE for 1D and 2D
