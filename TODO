it has been such a long time doing nothing with Meshach-EF,
I do not know anymore what is to do ...

Doc:
----

- finish HTML doc (folder "doc") with many many examples, especially Stokes/Navier-Stoke
(will I ever have the time for it ?)

- re-run mcstrip/cyclo, seems buggy on macosx (wrong function names)
- nroff doc update (I have forgotten how to do this)


Bugs:
-----

- for splines 1D , bc cauchy/robin do not work (not finished), but Dirichlet/Neumann Ok
- what else ?
- what else ?
- what else ?


Graphics:
---------

- unify cpgplot, vogle/vopl and libsciplot calls (1d)
- specifiy colors / background color in config files (and use them)
- BUG: vogle ignores VIEWPORT specs
- change MATLAB to OCTAVE for 1D and 2D
- Cairo based plotting lib (giza?, kplot?) to enable Win32 plotting
- Dislin ?

Misc:
-----

- gmsh new file format for cube in 3D
- AdvFunc clean


Python
------

- shall I continue the "python classes" wrappers of the SWIG objects ?
(lots of work but no real need). See PYTHON_WRAPPERS PyMAT etc... not finished anyway.
